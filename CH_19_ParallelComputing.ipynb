    "# CH19 Parallel Computing\n",
    "# Parallelism provides a number of benefits: High performance, Better use of resources, convenience, fault tolerance\n",
    "# There are two primary models for parallel computation:\n",
    "# - shared memory: Each processor can access any location in memory (appropriate for multicore)\n",
    "# - distributed memory: Each processor must explicitly send a message to another processor to access its memory.(appropriate for clusters)\n",
    "# Challenges in parallel programming:\n",
    "# - starvation, deadlock, livelock(a processor keeps retrying an operation that always fails)\n",
    "# Semaphore\n",
    "# - A semaphore is a very powerful synchronization construct. Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of permits. \n",
    "# - A thread calling acquire() on a semaphore waits, if necessary until a permit is available, and then takes it. \n",
    "# - A thread calling release() on a semaphore adds a permit and notifies threads waiting on that semaphore, potentially releasing a blocking acquirer."

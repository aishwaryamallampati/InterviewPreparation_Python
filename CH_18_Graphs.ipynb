    "# Some important notes:\n",
    "# A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph in which there are no cycles, i.e., paths which contain one or more edges and which begin and end at the same vertex.\n",
    "# A topological ordering of the vertices in a DAG is an ordering of the vertices in which each edge is from a vertex earlier in the ordering to a vertex later in the ordering\n",
    "# If G is an undirected graph, vertices u and o are said tobe connected if G contains a path from uto v;otherwise, u and v aresaid to be disconnected\n",
    "# A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected.\n",
    "# A connected component is a maximal set of vertices C such that each pair of vertices in C is connected in G\n",
    "# A directed graph is called \n",
    "# - weakly connected if replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges produces an undirected graph that is connected\n",
    "# - conntected if it contains a directed path from u to v or a directed path from v to u for every pair of vertices u and v.\n",
    "# - strongly connected if it contains a directed path from u to v and a directed path from v to u for every pair of vertices u and v.\n",
    "# A graph can be implemented in two ways-using adjacency lists or an adjacency matrix\n",
    "# - In the adjacency list representation, each vertex v, has a list of vertices to which it has an edge. \n",
    "# - The adjacency matrix representation uses a |V| x |V| Boolean-valued matrix indexed by vertices, with a 1 indicating the presence of an edge.\n",
    "# A free (sometimes called a free tree) is a special sort of graph-it is an undirected graph that is connected but has no cycles. \n",
    "# - Many equivalent definitions exist, e.g., a graph is a free tree if and only if there exists a unique path between every pair of vertices.\n",
    "# - Given a graph G = (V,E),if the graph G' = (V,E') where E' c E, is a tree, then G' is referred to as a spanning tree of G.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Graphs are ideal for modeling and analyzing relationships between pairs of objects.\n",
    "# Use graphs when the problem involves spatially connected objects such as roads etc.\n",
    "# Use graph when you need to analyze any binary relationship between objects such as interlinked webpages, followers in a social graph\n",
    "# Some graph problems entail anlayzing structure, ex: looking for cycles or connected componenets. DFS works well for these problems\n",
    "# BFS, Dijkstra shortest path and minimum spanning tree are examples of graph algorithms for optimization problems ex: find shortest path from one vertex to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Graph Search:\n",
    "# DFS and BFS => Time complexity: O(|V| + |E|)\n",
    "# BFS can be used to compute distances from the start vertex and DFS can be used to check for the presence of cycles."

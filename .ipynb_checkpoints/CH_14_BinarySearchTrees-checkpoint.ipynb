    "# Some important notes:\n",
    "# BST can solve almost every data structure problem reasonabley efficiently.\n",
    "# They can efficiently: search a key, find min and max, look for successor or predecessor of a search key and enumerate the keys in a range in sorted order.\n",
    "# BST property: nodes stores keys which are integers or strings, key > left_child and key < right_child\n",
    "# Insertion, deletion and lookup can take O(logn) - height of the tree if implemented efficiently\n",
    "# Height-balanced BSTs example - Red black trees\n",
    "# Important applications of BST:\n",
    "# - Searching is the fundamental application of BST. Find min, max, next largest/next smallest, lookup, delete and find all take O(logn) time using library imeplementations\n",
    "# - Both BST and hash table use O(n) space - generally BST use more space\n",
    "# - We can iterate through elements in sorted order in O(n) time using BST even if it is not balanced\n",
    "# - Sometimes it is better to use a combination of BST and hashtable to solve problems\n",
    "# Python does not have a built-in BST library. we can use bintrees module which implements sorted sets and sorted dictionaries using balanced BSTs.\n",
    "# Below, we describe the functionalities added by bintrees:(Time Complexity - O(logn) for each operation)\n",
    "# - insert(e) inserts new element e in the BST.\n",
    "# - discard(e) removes e in the BST if present.\n",
    "# - min-item()/max-item() yield the smallest and largest key-value pair in the BST.\n",
    "# - min-key()/max-key() yield the smallest and largest key in the BST.\n",
    "# - pop_min()/pop_max() remove and then return the smallest and largest key-value pair in the BST.\n",
    "# sortedcontainers module is the best-in-class module for sorted sets and sorted dictionaries"

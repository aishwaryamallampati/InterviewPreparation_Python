    "# Some important notes:\n",
    "# A number of sorting algorithms run in O(nlogn) time-heapsort, merge sort, and quicksort are examples. Each has its advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "# for example, heapsort is in-place but not stable; merge sort is stable but not in-place; quicksort runs O(n2) time in worst-case. \n",
    "# (An in-place sort is one which uses 0(1) space; a stable sort is one where entries which are equal appear in their original order.)\n",
    "# A well implemented quick sort is usually the best choice for sorting.\n",
    "# How to decide which sorting algorithm to use given a particular situation:\n",
    "# - For short arrays, e.g., 10 or fewer elements, insertion sort is easier to code and faster than asymptotically superior sorting algorithms. \n",
    "# - If every element is known to be at most k places from its final location, a min-heap can be used to get an O(nlogk) algorithm (Solution 10.3 on Page 137).\n",
    "# - If there are a small number of distinct keys, e.g., integers in the range [0..255], counting sort, which records for each element, the number of elements less than it, works well. \n",
    "# -- This count can be kept in an array (if the largest number is comparable in value to the size of the set being sorted) or a BST where the keys are the numbers and the values are their frequencies. \n",
    "# -- If there are many duplicate keys we can add the keys to a BST, with linked lists for elements which have the same key; the sorted result can be derived from an in-order traversal of the BST.\n",
    "# Sorting problems occur in the following two types:\n",
    "# - use sorting to make subsequent steps simpler => use a library sort function, possibly with a custom comparator\n",
    "# - design a custom sorting routine => use a data structure like a BST, heap or array indexed by values.\n",
    "# The following are the properties of Python sorting libraries:\n",
    "# - to sort list in-place use the sort() method\n",
    "# -- it returns None, the calling list itself is updated\n",
    "# -- Take two optional input paramets: \n",
    "# --- key which is a func which takes list elements and maps them to objects which are comparable. eg: a[1, 2, 4, 5, 0] a.sort(key=lambda x:str(x)) \n",
    "# --- reverse = True => descending order else ascending order(default)\n",
    "# - to sort an iterable, use the sorted().\n",
    "# -- leaves input unchanged and optional parameters same as sort()"

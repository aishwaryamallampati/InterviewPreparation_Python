    "# Some important notes:\n",
    "# DP is a general technique for solving optimization, search, and counting problems that can be decomposed into subproblems.\n",
    "# what makes DP different is that the same subproblem may reoccur. Therefore, a key to making DP efficient is caching the results of intermediate computations\n",
    "# The key to solving a DP problem efficiently is finding a way to break the problem into subproblems such that:\n",
    "# - the original problem can be solved relatively easily once solutions to the subproblems are available, and\n",
    "# - these subproblem solutions are cached.\n",
    "# Top tips for DP:\n",
    "# - Use DP whenever we have to make choices to arrive at the solution. Specifically, when you construct solution to the given instance from solutions to subinstances of smaller problems of the same kind.\n",
    "# - Apart from optimization problems, DP is also applicable to counting and decision problems\n",
    "# - Although conceptually DP involves recursion, often for efficiency the cache is built \"bottom up\", i.e., iteratively. \n",
    "# -- when DP is implemented recursively, the cache data structure is hash table or BST\n",
    "# -- when DP is implemented iteratively, the cache data structure is one or multi-dimensional array\n",
    "# - DP is based on combining solutions to subproblems to yield a solution to the original problem which might not work for all problems"

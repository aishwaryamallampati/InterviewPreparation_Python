    "# Some important notes\n",
    "# Binary Search: a natural elimination-based strategy for searching a sorted array.\n",
    "# Binary search is an effective search tool. It can also be used to search an interval of real numbers or integers\n",
    "# If your searching algo requires sorting and if the computation after sorting is faster than sorting (O(n) or O(logn)), look for solutions that do not perform complete sort\n",
    "# Consider time/space tradeoffs, such as making multiple passes through the data\n",
    "# The bisect module provides binary search functions for sorted list. Consider A is a sorted list:\n",
    "# - To find the first element that is not less than a targeted value, use bisect.bisect_left (a , x). This call retums the index of the first entry that is greater than or equal to the targeted value.\n",
    "#   If all elements in the list are less than x, the retumed value is len(a).\n",
    "# - Tofindthefirstelementthatisgreaterthanatargetedvalue,use bisect.bisect_right(a,x). This call retums the index of the first entry that is greater than the targeted value. If all elements\n",
    "#   in the list are less than or equal to x, the retumed value is len(a).\n",
    "#In an interview, if it is allowed, use the above functions, instead of implementing your own binary search."
